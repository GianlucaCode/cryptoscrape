# crypto-scrape
This is crypto-scrape, a simple webscraper designed to get information on various crypto-currencies from popular online forums and imageboards.

## Why?
crypto-scrape is designed as a tool to be used in conjunction with other projects. By harnessing the power of crypto-scrape, one can easily compare mentions and other metrics of popularity between different crypto-currencies.

These comparsions can then be used to judge the realibilty of crypto-scrape's metrics in predicting changes in crypto-currency value, or to make selling and purchasing decisions. crypto-scrape is simply a way to get that data.

## Configuration
Each source has its own folder within the sources directory. Inside each source's folder are three text files: ```info.txt```, ```included.txt ```, and ```cryptos.txt``` with ```info.txt ``` holding information on setting up that particular source.

## Roadmap
1. Write data from mention-scraping from reddit into a SQLite3 table
2. Further testing on reddit scraping from different sources and of different currencies
3. Move on to other websites...
